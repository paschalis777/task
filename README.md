# To-Do List
To-Do List Manager
This app is a **Simple To-Do List Manager** designed for tracking tasks efficiently. Users can:

1. **View Tasks**: See all their current to-dos.
2. **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new items to their list.
3. **Remove Tasks**: Delete completed or unwanted tasks.

The app uses an **SQLite database** to ensure tasks are saved persistently, even after the app is closed. This makes it lightweight yet robust. It can be packaged as a standalone application for easy distribution and use, making it ideal for basic task management.
